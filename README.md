# Game-Project-Snake
A University project for our first class in C programming<br />
Chose to program the game Snake using raw C's features to impllement OOP behaviours<br />
(because I tried not OOP and it suited game programming very poorly)

Implemented features such as...
- collision with hitboxes
- using collision to collect a treat and add to both the score and snake's length
- track score history through a .dat file and detect a new high score
- class behaviour via structs
- the snake was able to "teleport" to the opposite side of the world like Pacman when it bumped into a wall. Now, the game ends

TODO
- acknowledge how badly I documented my work in 1st year
- fix how badly I documented this project
