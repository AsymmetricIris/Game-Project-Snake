# Game-Project-Snake
A University project for our first class in C programming
Chose to program the game Snake using raw C's features to impllement OOP behaviours 
(because I tried not OOP and it suited game programming very poorly)

Implemented features such as...
- collision with hitboxes
- using collision to collect a treat and add to both the score and snake's length
- track the score through a txt file
- class behaviour via structs
- the snake was able to "teleport" to the opposite side of the world like Pacman when it bumped into a wall. Now, the game ends
